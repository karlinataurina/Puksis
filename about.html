            <div class="About"><h2>A little something about me</h2>
        <p> I like playing with toys and most of all - sleeping. You could say I'm a champion in sleeping!<br>
        I like food too. My favorite food is grilled turkey or sometimes I steal blueberries or strawberries from my mom, I know I'm not supposed to eat them, but I <i>reeeaally</i> like them!<br>
        I sometimes get bored, so to get rid of boredom I find new and exciting things to do and explore!<br>
        <br>One time I found a paper bag full of stuff. It looked interesting so I put my head in it to smell it.<br>
        I immediately felt something on my neck so I panicked and started running around the house to get rid of the thing, but it was chasing me! Good thing mom was chasing the thing and got rid of it!<br>
        Turns out it was a trash bag and the thing around my neck was bag handle. Anyway, it was <i>super scary</i> at the time!</p></div>
